# Travel checklist
A travel checklist app in React
[work in progress]

## Features
* Organize items by category: clothes, toiletries, pre-departure tasks...
* The night before your trip, complete your "do in advance" list, which shows you only the items you can actually check off, like socks. Then switch to the "last minute" list for the items you'll need until the day you leave, like your toothbrush and phone charger.
* Create different trip types associated with variations on your list: for example, "international" (need your passport), or "visiting family" (omit some items that you have at their place).
* Add or omit items on a per-trip basis that you don't expect to repeat, like a gift for a specific trip
